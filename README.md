# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game for one player (you) against the computer.

## How to Play

1. Run the program in a C-compatible development environment.
2. The game begins with a 3x3 grid, and you are "X," while the computer is "0."

## Gameplay

The game alternates between your turn and the computer's turn until one of the following conditions is met:

- You win by having three of your marks ('X') in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- The computer wins by having three of its marks ('0') in a row.
- The grid is filled, resulting in a draw.

## Rules

- You play by entering the row and column where you want to place your 'X' (e.g., `1 2` for the first row, second column).
- The computer generates its moves randomly.
- The game announces the winner or declares a draw.

## Getting Started

To run this game, make sure you have a C-compatible development environment set up. Compile and run the code to enjoy the game.
